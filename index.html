{% include feature_row id="intro" type="center" %}

I'm a self proclaimed nerd, and proud to be. I believe in equality, compassion, and the idea that there is more to life than most let on. Eternally optimistic with my eyes on the future. I must have a plan and I enjoy fully completing any task.

<br />

Father of two wonderful children who have completely changed my life for the better. I want to build a better world for them. This space is intended to collect all of my digital projects and accomplishments. A sort of portfolio and resume all wrapped in one. If you have a new idea, exciting project or just want to take over the world, get in touch!
